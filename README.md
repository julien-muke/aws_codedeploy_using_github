## <a name="introduction">ü§ñ Introduction</a>

In this demo, we are going learn how to upload code from our local computer to a remote repository in GitHub. Once the code is in GitHub it automatically triggers a code pipeline to take that code and deploy it on our AWS EC2 using CodeDeploy.

## <a name="steps">‚òëÔ∏è Steps</a>

* Setup IAM Roles
* Setup EC2 as Deployment Server
* Integrate GitHub as a source/repository
* Setup application & Deployment Group
* Setup CodeDeply Pipeline
* Deploy Application on EC2 once the code is in GitHub it automatically triggers a code pipeline to take that code and deploy it on EC2 using Code deploy.


## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 1 - Setup IAM Roles

A. First, create an IAM Role for EC2

To create a role:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
2. In the navigation pane of the console, choose Roles and then choose Create role.

3. Choose AWS service as Trusted entity type
4. Choose EC2 as Use case

5. Choose `AmazonEC2RoleforAWSCodeDeploy` policies to attach to your new role

6. Enter Role name `EC2CodeDeployRole`
7. You will see a Trust policy already attached to you role
8. You will see the Permissions policy already attached to you role

B. Second, create an IAM Role for CodeDeploy

Let's follow the same steps as our first IAM Role, with a CodeDeploy use case:

1. In the navigation pane of the console, choose Roles and then choose Create role.
2. Choose AWS service as Trusted entity type
3. Choose `CodeDeploy` as Use case
4. Choose `AWSCodeDeployRole` policies to attach to your new role
5. Enter Role name `CodeDeployRole`
6. Click "Next" and save changes


## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 2 - Setup EC2 as Deployment Server

To launch an instance:

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
2. In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, you can use the selected Region, or optionally select a Region that is closer to you.
3. From the EC2 console dashboard, in the Launch instance pane, choose `Launch instance`.

![Launch instance](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws_codedeploy_using_github/assets/110755734/c0667b1a-c639-4c99-86b9-b013531f5d3a)


4. Under Name and tags, for Name, enter a descriptive name for your instance, i will name it `MyInstance`
5. Under Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image), Choose Quick Start, and then choose the operating system (OS) for your instance. For your first Linux instance, we recommend that you choose Amazon Linux.
6. From Amazon Machine Image (AMI), select an AMI that is marked Free Tier eligible.

7. Under Instance type, for Instance type, choose t2.micro, which is eligible for the Free Tier. In Regions where t2.micro is not available, t3.micro is eligible for the Free Tier.
8. Under Key pair, for this demo choose Proceed without a key pair (Not recommended)

9. Under Network settings, select "Create security group" then choose "Allow SSH traffic from" and "Allow HTTP traffic from the internet"

10. Under Advanced details, select `EC2CodeDeployRole` that we created as IAM instance profile

11. Allow tags in metadata by choosing "Enable"
12. For User data, let's Upload a file with the user data, copy and paste file below:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo yum -y update
sudo yum -y install ruby
sudo yum -y install wget
cd /home/ec2-user
wet https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/install
sudo chmod +x ./install
sudo ./install auto
sudo yum install -y python-pip
sudo pip install awscli
```

13. Click "Launch instance"


## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 3 - Setup CodeDeply Pipeline

To create an application for an in-place deployment using the CodeDeploy console:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodeDeploy console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy.
2. In the navigation pane, expand Deploy, and then choose Getting started.
3. Choose Create application

4. In Application name, enter the name of your application `MyApp`
5. From Compute Platform, choose EC2/On-premises
6. Choose Create application

7. On your application page, from the Deployment groups tab, choose Create deployment group

![deploymentgroup](https://github.com/julien-muke/aws_codedeploy_using_github/assets/110755734/b75e9bfe-c92a-44b6-b408-951b34dd5534)

8. In Deployment group name, enter a name that describes the deployment group `MyApp-deployment-group`

9. In Service role, choose a service role that grants CodeDeploy access to your target instance, the one that we created
10. In Deployment type, choose In-place.
11. In Environment configuration, select Amazon EC2 instances
12. In the Key and Value fields, enter Name as key and MyInstance as value
13. In Deployment settings, choose a deployment configuration to control the rate your application is deployed to instances, such as all at once.
14. Uncheck Enable load balancing
15. Choose Create deployment group
