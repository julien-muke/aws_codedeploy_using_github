## <a name="introduction">ü§ñ Introduction</a>

In this demo, we are going learn how to upload code from our local computer to a remote repository in GitHub. Once the code is in GitHub it automatically triggers a code pipeline to take that code and deploy it on our AWS EC2 using CodeDeploy.

## <a name="steps">‚òëÔ∏è Steps</a>

* Setup IAM Roles
* Setup EC2 as Deployment Server
* Integrate GitHub as a source/repository
* Setup application & Deployment Group
* Setup CodeDeply Pipeline
* Deploy Application on EC2 once the code is in GitHub it automatically triggers a code pipeline to take that code and deploy it on EC2 using Code deploy.


## ‚û°Ô∏è Step 1 - Setup IAM Roles

A. First, create an IAM Role for EC2

To create a role:

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
2. In the navigation pane of the console, choose Roles and then choose Create role.

3. Choose AWS service as Trusted entity type
4. Choose EC2 as Use case

5. Choose `AmazonEC2RoleforAWSCodeDeploy` policies to attach to your new role

6. Enter Role name `EC2CodeDeployRole`
7. You will see a Trust policy already attached to you role
8. You will see the Permissions policy already attached to you role

B. Second, create an IAM Role for CodeDeploy

Let's follow the same steps as our first IAM Role, with a CodeDeploy use case:

1. In the navigation pane of the console, choose Roles and then choose Create role.
2. Choose AWS service as Trusted entity type
3. Choose `CodeDeploy` as Use case
4. Choose `AWSCodeDeployRole` policies to attach to your new role
5. Enter Role name `CodeDeployRole`
6. Click "Next" and save changes
